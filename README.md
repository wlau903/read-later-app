# Read Later

This is a Ruby on Rails v5 web application that enables users to save articles onto virtual reading lists, with article information scraped from The Guardian website (US edition).

Articles are organized by category and subcategory, and are saved onto lists with a title and url.

Any user can browse articles, but only those with login credentials have the ability to save. Users can create accounts through the application or login via Google. 

## Usage

To use, clone, run: `bundle install`, `rails db:migrate` and then start up the server with: `rails s`.
